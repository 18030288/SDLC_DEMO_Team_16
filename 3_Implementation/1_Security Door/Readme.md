## Introduction:

Nowadays most of the systems are automated in order to face new challenges and present day requirements to achieve good results.
 Automated systems have less manual operations, so that the flexibility, reliabilities are high and accurate.
 
## Principle Behind The Circuit:

The main component in the circuit is 8051 controller. In this project 4×3 keypad is used to enter the password. The password which is entered is compared with the predefined password. If the entered password is correct then the system opens the door by rotating door motor and displays the status of door on LCD. If the password is wrong then door is remain closed and a sound alarm is triggered and displays “Password is wrong” on LCD.
